# Kernel Agent README
## Project Overview
The Kernel Agent is a Python-based tool designed to optimize kernel code for specific hardware configurations. It leverages advanced technologies such as hardware detection, kernel execution, and performance metric collection to provide optimized kernel code.

### Key Features
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically detects available hardware and selects the most suitable configuration for optimization.
- **Kernel Execution**: Executes kernel code on the target hardware and collects performance metrics.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzes performance metrics and optimizes kernel code for better performance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Compatible hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GPU)
- Required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/botirk38/kernel_agent.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Kernel Agent: `python main.py`

## Usage
### Basic Examples
- Optimize kernel code for a given hardware description: `python main.py optimize --hardware-description <hardware_description>`
- Analyze previously generated optimization results: `python main.py analyze --results-file <results_file>`

### Common Use Cases
- Optimizing kernel code for a specific GPU model
- Analyzing performance metrics for a given kernel code
- Generating optimized kernel code for a particular hardware configuration

## Architecture Overview
The Kernel Agent consists of the following main components:
- **Hardware Detector**: Responsible for detecting available hardware and selecting the most suitable configuration for optimization.
- **Kernel Executor**: Executes kernel code on the target hardware and collects performance metrics.
- **Hardware Optimization Agent**: Analyzes performance metrics and optimizes kernel code for better performance.

The workflow of the Kernel Agent is as follows:
1. The user provides a hardware description and kernel code to optimize.
2. The Hardware Detector detects the available hardware and selects the most suitable configuration for optimization.
3. The Kernel Executor executes the kernel code on the target hardware and collects performance metrics.
4. The Hardware Optimization Agent analyzes the performance metrics and optimizes the kernel code for better performance.

## Error Handling and Logging
The Kernel Agent handles errors and exceptions that may occur during kernel execution, optimization, or other critical processes. The repository uses a combination of try-except blocks and logging mechanisms to handle and report issues.

## Future Development and Contributions
There are plans for future development, extensions, and improvements to the `kernel_agent` repository. Opportunities for contributors to get involved and help shape the direction of the project include:
- Implementing support for additional hardware vendors
- Developing new optimization algorithms and techniques
- Improving the user interface and experience

Contributors can get involved by forking the repository, creating a new branch, and submitting a pull request with their changes. The project maintainers will review and merge contributions that align with the project's goals and vision.
